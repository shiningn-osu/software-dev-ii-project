## Communication Channels / Policies

* Primary Asynchronous: Discord
* Primary Synchronous (outside of regular meetings): Teams
* Rules for Communication:
    * Discussion Policy: To encourage positive/creative discussion, group members will refrain from interrupting others’ ideas and from putting down any ideas during the discussion. It is expected that all group members speak respectfully of each other and allow others to voice their opinions without belittlement. To resolve disagreements the group members will seek to form a compromise between the two perspectives that led to the disagreement. In the case where compromise cannot be reached between the group members, then the group will seek third party input from a source outside of the group. The perspective that the third party selects will be the option that the group members use.
    * Project Management Policy: For project management, we will use a GitHub Project Kanban board. We will manage the tasks' status between ready, in progress, and done to reflect the current status of tasks. We will also assign tasks to individuals to reflect who is responsible for the task. Additionally, we will also put a size and time estimate on tasks to better divide up the workload between us. We will also note the dates that these tasks are due so that we can better manage our time.
    * Confusion Policy: If a team member gets confused about what to do, they should communicate that confusion in the Discord. If the confusion relates to something time sensitive, then they can send an email as well. Synchronous Microsoft Teams meetings may also be scheduled if the group members deem such a meeting necessary to resolve the confusion. 
    * Late Messaging Policy: If a message sender sends a discord message, and they do not hear back within 12 hours (24 hours on the weekend), then they can send an email. This message may either reiterate the points of the discord message, or direct the recipient to the discord message. If there is no response to the email within 12 hours, then follow up text messages may be sent. 
    * Falling Behind Policy: If a team member falls behind in their work, then they can post a message on Discord relaying that they are behind on their work. This message may request for either guidance or assistance from the other group member. In the event where the issue is time-sensitive or there is a large amount of work to catch up, an in-person meeting will be scheduled to dedicate time toward the unfinished work. 
    * Exigent Circumstances Policy: If a group member believes that they will fall behind due to upcoming exigent circumstances, then they are expected to relay that in the group Discord. From there, the group will redistribute the work such that the person who has the exigent circumstances has a workload that they can accomplish, and the other work has been divided among the group. The group’s work redistribution allotments will be such that the redistribution is agreed as reasonable by all group members. For the next workload allotment, the individual that had exigent circumstances will take on an additional workload to make up for the previous reallotment such that the new allotment is agreed as reasonable by all group members.
    * Failure to Contribute Policy: If a group member fails to contribute sufficiently to the project during a week, then they should do an additional portion or task for the next week’s project work. The distribution of the portions between group members should be agreed upon by the group members such that they both deem it fair. In the event where a group member has continuously failed to contribute sufficiently to an assignment, then the group may discuss the issue collectively and agree on an action plan to address the lack of contribution and the method for the non-contributing group member to make up the work that they’ve failed to complete.
