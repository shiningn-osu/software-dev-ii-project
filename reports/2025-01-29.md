## C. Progress and Issues

### What We Did
- We developed a rudimentary sub-group timeline for what needs to be done for the project to be built, and by which sub-group at which time in the term
- We determined 7 software components, 3 functionalities of those components, and 3 implementations.
- We developed 3 database schemas for what data will end up being stored in the database
- We developed 5 assumptions underpinning our chosen architecture
- Began development on the website’s design wireframes and prototypes.

### What Worked
- N/A

### What We Learned
- We learned about what kinds of things need to be completed so that we can finish our project
- We learned about what data schemas we need to center our information transfers around when sending information between the react pages and the server.
- We learned about a potential JavaScript coding style in the AirBnB coding style guide - https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

### Where We Had Trouble
- We had a bit of trouble with delaying the completion of the work until close to the deadline.

### Where We Are Stuck
- N/A

Measurable task and time estimates. No task greater than 3 days.
- Develop the remaining 4 functionalities and implementations of the 7 identified software components by next Tuesday at 11:59pm
  - **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
- Complete the Software Design section of the Project Architecture and Design document, such that each prompt for each component has at least 2 sentences, by next Tuesday night at 11:59pm.
  - **Time Estimate:** 3 hours
