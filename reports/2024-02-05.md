## C. Progress and Issues

### What We Did
- We developed a full timeline for the internal and external events needing to be completed that relate to the project for the rest of the term. Each event has what it is reliant on, the team that is responsible for it being done, the due date, and additional notes.
- We wrote out the 4 remaining software functionality descriptions as well as the implementation descriptions in the living doc.
- We wrote the second decision pertaining to our software and the pros and cons of an alternative in the living doc.
- We described 7 packages/classes and responsibilities of our 7 components in the Software Design section of the living doc.
- We described details about 5 risks that our project development faces, and ways to mitigate those risks.
- Created a testing and bug management plan for the project, that entailed 4 major testing methodologies
- Created a documentation plan that entailed 2 top level documents, and 3 practices for how to document code in the files themselves.
- Developed the Figma prototypes for the Home page, the Food page, and the Grocery page.
- Built the file structure, initial backend API / database server files, and React frontend files and infrastructure necessary to begin coding and to be able to view changes made through code in a browser.

### What Worked

### What We Learned
- How we should structure the pull request review process among ourselves.
